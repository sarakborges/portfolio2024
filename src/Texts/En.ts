export const EXPERIENCES_TEXT = `I am a front-end developer with over ten years of experience, driven by curiosity and a passion for continuous learning. While I have a strong technical foundation, I recognize there’s always more to learn — especially through collaboration with knowledgeable colleagues. I believe this collaborative spirit is essential for success, and I thrive in teams that prioritize knowledge-sharing.

Clear communication is a priority for me, as I see it as the best way to overcome challenges and build effective solutions together. I appreciate workplaces where my input is valued, and I foster open, constructive conversations, always showing the same respect to my colleagues’ perspectives. I’m also committed to sharing my knowledge and supporting others on the team whenever possible.

I’ve had brief but impactful experiences as both a Scrum Master and a technical reference, and these experiences have only reinforced my ambition to step into a technical leadership role. I am confident I can excel in this position because I strongly believe in the power of effective leadership and truly enjoy working with people, inspiring them, and drawing inspiration in return.`
