export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I have vast experience working as a front-end developer (over 10 years), but also understand I do not possess all the knowledge in the world. I am a collaborative individual, learn fast when provided with a peer with more knowledge on the topic, and a team player.

I value clear communication a lot, as I believe it is the best way to conquer challenges. I like to have my opinions valued, as I value my mates opinions. I also enjoy sharing knowledge whenever I can, and had a brief experience as scrum master and technical reference at some projects.

My professional goal is to become a technical leader. If provided the opportunity, I am sure I can excel at that position, as I really enjoy working with people.`
