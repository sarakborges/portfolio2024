export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Nice to meet you! My name is Sara, I’m 32 years old, and I live in Porto Alegre, RS. I’m a trans woman who loves technology and nerdy things in general. My hobbies include RPG, cosplay, and discovering new places! I fell in love with front-end development in 2012, during my first professional experience, when I was responsible for the visual part of several e-commerce platforms and could openly communicate with the design team to always find the best solutions for our clients.

What fascinates me about the development field is the diversity and inclusion, respect for everyone, the light and relaxed atmosphere, the exchange of knowledge, and the collaboration across different areas of expertise. I feel that if any of these characteristics are missing, the work environment cannot function at a high level.`

Known for a collaborative mindset and a passion for continuous learning, I thrive in environments that value knowledge-sharing and teamwork.

I prioritize clear communication as a key to overcoming challenges and delivering effective solutions. My approach fosters open, constructive discussions where all perspectives are respected, enabling innovative outcomes. I am equally committed to mentoring teammates, sharing expertise, and supporting their growth.

My brief yet impactful experiences as a Scrum Master and technical reference have fueled my ambition to transition into a technical leadership role. I am confident in my ability to excel in such a position, combining strong technical expertise with a people-focused leadership style to inspire and drive team success.`
